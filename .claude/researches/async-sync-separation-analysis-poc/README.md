# Async/Sync Separation POC Files

This directory contains proof-of-concept implementations created during the async/sync separation research.

## Files

### TypeScript Implementations
- `pangu-minimal.ts` - Core functionality in ~60 lines, showing the essential logic
- `pangu-simplified.ts` - Full implementation with clear async/sync method separation
- `pangu-ultra-simple.ts` - Even simpler version focusing on API clarity
- `pangu-public-api.ts` - Complete public API design with all convenience methods
- `task-scheduler-simplified.ts` - Simplified task queue without configuration complexity

### Documentation
- `SIMPLIFICATION_COMPARISON.md` - Before/after code comparison
- `SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of benefits and migration examples
- `SIMPLIFICATION_FINAL.md` - Final analysis and recommendations

## Purpose

These files demonstrate how the codebase could be simplified by:
1. Separating async and sync methods explicitly
2. Removing configuration-based behavior switching
3. Reducing from ~1000 lines to ~300 lines of core logic

## Status

**Not for production use** - These are research artifacts showing what's possible, not actual implementations. The main research conclusions are in the parent `async-sync-separation-analysis.md` file.

## Key Insights

- The core spacing logic is surprisingly simple (~60 lines)
- Most complexity comes from configuration branching
- Explicit method names (`spacingPage()` vs `spacingPageSync()`) are clearer than config flags
- ~250 lines of code could be eliminated with this approach

See the main research document for the final recommendation.
